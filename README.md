**Abstract**

*Context.*
Comparisons of optical positions derived from the Gaia mission
and radio positions measured by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
probe the structure of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the
milli-arcsecond (mas) scale. So far, such comparisons have focused on using
the S/X band (2/8 GHz) radio positions but have not taken advantage of the
VLBI positions that exist at higher radio frequencies, namely K band (24 GHz)
and X/Ka band (8/32 GHz).

*Aims.*
We extend previous works by considering two additional radio frequencies
(K band and X/Ka band) with the aim to study the frequency dependence of
the source positions and its potential connection with the physical
properties of the underlying AGN.

*Methods.*
We compared the absolute source positions measured at four different
wavelengths, that is, the optical position from the Gaia Early Data Release 3
(EDR3) and the radio positions at the dual S/X, X/Ka combinations and at
K band, as available from the third realization of the International
Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3), for 512 common sources.
We first aligned the three ICRF3 individual catalogs onto the Gaia EDR3 frame
and compare the optical-to-radio offsets before and after the alignment.
Then we studied the correlation of optical-to-radio offsets with the
observing (radio) frequency, source morphology, magnitude, redshift,
and source type.

*Results*
The deviation among optical-to-radio offsets determined in the different
radio bands is less than 0.5 mas, but there is statistical evidence that
the optical-to-radio offset is smaller at K band compared to S/X band for
sources showing extended structures.
The optical-to-radio offset was found to statistically correlate with the
structure index.
Large optical-to-radio offsets appear to favor faint sources but are well
explained by positional uncertainty, which is also larger for these sources.
We did not detect any statistically significant correlation between the
optical-to-radio offset and the redshift.

*Conclusions.*
The radio source structure might also be a major cause for the
radio-to-optical offset.
For the alignment of with the Gaia celestial reference frame, the S/X band
frame remains the preferred choice at present.
